Surface Hydrology Viewer
================================

[Live Demo](https://ks-cig-webmap.appspot.com)

This is a test repository for a surface hydrology viewer that visualizes some of our surface water analyses on Google Earth Engine that we hacked out of Google Trendy Lights. It needs some re-factoring, but is otherwise in working order and can be used as a template for other Earth Engine work.
